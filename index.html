        <h1>Burden of disease in West Sussex</h1>
        <p>The Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD) is one of the most comprehensive worldwide epidemiological collaborations describing mortality and morbidity from major diseases and injuries and risk factors to health at global, national, regional, and local levels. It provides a standardised approach to estimating incidence (new cases) and prevalence (total number of cases) of ill health and death as well as a measure of the number of potential years lost due to disability, ill health and death.</p>

        <p>Where possible, local observational data (e.g. mortality and GP records or local studies) are included in the estimates but for a large number of diseases there is simply no recorded information on prevalence. The GBD ethos is that an uncertain estimate, even when data are sparse or not available, is preferable to no estimate at all. As a result, you should consider that there is a <b>margin of error when interpreting these results as they are simply estimates or <i>'best guesses'</i></b>.</p>
        <p>The 2017 overview for England is available <a href = "http://www.healthdata.org/united-kingdom-england" target = "_blank">here</a href></p>

<h2>Top 10 in West Sussex</h2>
<p>The leading burdens of disease in West Sussex in 2017 are given in the table below. These are the 'level two' cause groups. You'll notice there are actually four top 10s and these reflect the various ways conditions affect our health.</p>
<p>We can measure mortality not just by counting the number of deaths (the far left of the table) but also the years of life lost, as a measure of the burden of disease on premature mortality. We can also estimate the number of years lived with disability for conditions which are not always fatal (at least not in the short term).</p>

<div id = "top_10_table"> </div>

<p>We now explore each of these four measures in more detail for West Sussex.</p>

<!-- Perhaps we can get this graphic to either move when the causes are clicked, or perhaps highlighted, or perhaps have the cause groups cluster together -->
<!-- Would be good to be able to split males vs females or change the year. -->

<p>The figure below shows the estimated number of deaths in West Sussex in 2017 by cause (level 3 causes). Causes are coloured by the 'cause group' (level 2 cause). Hover over a circle to see more information.

<h2>Years of life lost</h2>

<h2>Disability adjusted life-years (DALYs) lost</h2>

<p>So far we have looked at the estimates for mortality, that is, what kills people. However, there are many people who continue to live with certain conditions to a greater or lesser extent of disability. Whilst the biggest contributers to mortality are generally the biggest contributers to disability and ill health, some conditions which have fairly low mortality rates can cause significant levels of disability.</p>

<!-- A good example of this is Musculoskeletal disorders which cause -->

<p>In the next section we focus on the three disease groups which contributed the most disability adjusted life-years lost in West Sussex in 2017 (Cancers (neoplasms), Cardiovascular diseases and Musculoskeletal disorders).</p>

<h2>Cancers (neoplasms)</h2>

<h2>Cardiovascular diseases</h2>

<h2>Musculoskeletal disorders</h2>

<h2>Exploring conditions in more detail</h2>
<p>It is not possible to provide a commentary on all 360 diseases/conditions but you can use the drop down boxes below to explore more detail on conditions.</p>

<h2>Concepts</h2>
<h3>Deaths</h3>
<p>In England, vital registers are maintained by the Office for National Statistics (ONS), which record the underlying cause of death for every death. Whilst the GBD study uses these registers for estimates of deaths because there is a complete population coverage, a small proportion of causes of death arere-coded to other causes in line with GBD algorithms identifying non-specific, ill-defined or other causes not considered underlying causes by ONS.</p>
<h3>Years of life lost</h3>
<p>YLLs are calculated by subtracting the age at death from the longest possible life expectancy for a person at that age. For example, if the longest life expectancy for men in a given country is 75, but a man dies of cancer at 65, this would be 10 years of life lost due to cancer.</p>
<h3>Years lived with disability</h3>
<p>These are estimates of the number of years lived in less than ideal health. Some conditions such as influenza last for only a few days, whereas epilepsy can last a lifetime. It is measured by taking the prevalence of the condition multiplied by a disability weight which reflects the severity of different conditions and these are developed using a variety of data sources. For England, this includes national surveys, the national cancer registration system, hospital episode statistics and multiple published studies on various disease and condition topics.</p>
<h3>Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs)</h3>
<p>One DALY equals one lost year of healthy life and is the sum of years of life lost and years lived with disability. This is the best measure to consider the overall impact of a specific cause or group of causes on a population.</p>

    <h2>Further information:</h2>
    <p>Data are available for every year between 1990 and 2017 and each year new data and methodological innovations are fed into models, revising annual estimates for 360 diseases and injuries and 85 risk factors.</p>
    <p>The GBD 2017 diseases/conditions are split and aggregated into four hierarchical levels.</p>
    <p>Level 1 contains three broad cause groups (communicable, maternal, neonatal and nutirional diseases (CMNN), non-communicable diseases (NCD) and injuries).</p>
    <p>These are then split into 22 level 2 cause groups and 169 level 3 diseases/conditions. Some of the level 3 conditions are further expanded to 165 level 4 diseases/conditions.</p>
    <p>For this analysis we explore levels 1,2, and 3.</p>
