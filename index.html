      <h1>Exploring the [global] burden of disease in West Sussex in 2017</h1>
      <p>The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) is one of the most comprehensive, worldwide, epidemiological collaborations describing life expectancy, as well as mortality and morbidity from major diseases and injuries and risk factors to health at global, national, regional, and local levels. The GBD provides a standardised approach to estimating incidence (new cases) and prevalence (total number of cases) of ill health and death as well as a measure of the number of potential years lost due to disability, ill health and death.</p>
      <p>Data are currently available for years between 1990 and 2017 and each year new data and methodological innovations are fed into models, revising annual estimates for 360 diseases and injuries and 85 risk factors.</p>
      <p>There is a vast wealth of data available in the GBD, and it is impossible to try to cover all of it in this analysis, which serves to present an overall picture of burden of disease in West Sussex. The data is all publically available from the <a href="http://ghdx.healthdata.org/gbd-results-tool" target="_blank">GBD online results tool;</a href> but please contact me if you want some help accessing or exploring particular questions that arise from this preliminary analysis.</p>

                  <h3>Caveats and limitations</h3>
                  <p class='side'>The GBD ethos is that an uncertain estimate, even when data are sparse or not available, is preferable to no estimate at all. As a result, you should consider that there is a <b>margin of error when interpreting these results as they are simply estimates or <i>'best guesses'</i></b>.</p>
                  <p class='side'>Estimates from the GBD do not compare directly to reported statistics within England (where these are available) as all estimates are constructed using the GBD methodology.</p>
                  <p class='side'>A change in rank does not necessarily mean that a metric for a cause has got better/worse.</p>
                  <p class='side'>Whilst risk factors are presented in three groups, these should not be viewed as mutually exclusive. It is clear that behavioural risks (such as diet) are associated with metabolic risks (such as obesity)</p>
                  <p class='side'>The GBD 2017 diseases/conditions and risks are split and aggregated into hierarchical levels. The cause list is mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive at every level of aggregation; causes not individually specified are captured in residual categories, such as 'other intestinal infectious diseases'.</p>

                  <h1>Is life expectancy improving in West Sussex?</h1>
                  <p>Life expectancy has increased in the last 20 years, from 79 years in 1997 to 81.7 years in 2017 (81.3 years to 83.5 years among females and from 76.5 years to 79.9 years among males). In the last five years, however, overall life expectancy at birth has actually gone down (from 82.2 years in 2012).</p>
                  <p>Healthy life expectancy has also increased since 1997 from 68.4 years overall (69.5 years and 67 years for females and males respectively) to 69.9 years in 2017 (70.6 years and 69.1 years for females and males respectively). The gain in healthy life expectancy has not been as high (in terms of percentage increase or actual years) compared to gains in overall life expectancy, and similar to overall life expectancy, healthy life expectancy estimates have declined since 2012.</p>
                  <h3>Life expectancy and healthy life expectancy at birth by sex; West Sussex; 1990 - 2017</h3>
                  <div id='le_timeseries_datavis'></div>
                  <p>There are stark differences in life expectancy by sex; with male life expectancy consistently trailing behind female life expectancy. In fact, it took until 2011, for male life expectancy at birth (80.3 years) in West Sussex to reach the life expectancy at birth for females in 1990 (80.1 years), although by this time, female life expectancy at birth was now 83.8 years.</p>
                  <p>The gap between male and female life expectancy has narrowed over time. In 1990, when estimates start, females could expect to live 5.2 years longer (80.1 years) compared to males who, on average would not live to see their 75th birthdays (74.9 years). In 2007, male life expactancy at birth had risen to 79.3 years and female life expectancy had risen to 83 years (a gap of 3.7 years). The gap has largely stayed around 3.5 years since then.<p>
                  <p>The gap is consistently narrower between males and females for healthy life expectancy; around 3 years in 1990, dropping to 1.5 years in 2007 and fluctuating around this figure since.</p>
                  <p>It is possible to combine these two estimates (overall life expectancy and healthy life expectancy) to explore how much time, on average, a person could expect to live in good and poor health and how this changes over time and between males and females. The figure below shows the healthy life expectancy and years lived in poorer health. You can hover over the bars to find out more, and switch between persons, females and males using the button at the top of the figure.</p>
                  <h3>Healthy life expectancy and living with disability and poor health; West Sussex; 1990-2017</h3>
                  <div class="switch-field">
                      <button onclick="update_le_1(data_b)" id="radio-le_stack-one" name="switch-le_stack">Persons</button>
                      <button onclick="update_le_1(data_f)" id="radio-le_stack-two" name="switch-le_stack">Females</button>

                  </div>
                  <div id='le_stacked_timeseries_datavis'></div>
                  <p>A person born in 2017, can expect to live (on average) 69.9 years in good health and 11.9 years living with some level of disability or illness. This equates to 14.5% which is <b>one in seven years spent in less than ideal health</b>. This proportion of time spent with some burden of disease is the highest
                      since 1990 when, a person could expect to live 13.3% of their life (10.3 years) with some disability or
                      illness. The proportion has either remained stable or increased every year since 1990.</p>
                  <p>Females consistently have a larger gap between healthy life expectancy and overall life expectancy
                      compared to males. Females born in 2017 could expect (on average) to live 15.5% (12.9 years) in less
                      than ideal health whilst males could expect to live 13.5% (10.8 years) in equivalent burden.</p>
                  <p>So, whilst life expectancy has largely increased over time in West Sussex and male life expectancy has
                      crept closer to female life expectancy, females spend more of their time in poorer health. It appears
                      that the narrowing of the gap between males and females could be explained in part by slightly larger
                      gains in male health expectancies.</p>

                  <h3>Life expectancy</h3>
                  <p class='side'>Life expectancy is a measure of the number of years an average person can expect to live at
                      a given age. For this analysis, we explore the life expactancy at birth (up to 1 year old age).</p>
                  <h3>Healthy life expectancy</h3>
                  <p class='side'>Healthy life expectancy takes into acount the non-fatal burden of disease and summarises the
                      number of years an average person can expect to live without poor health. The difference between Healthy
                      life expectancy and Life expectancy generally, gives us an idea of the average time people spend in poor
                      health.</p>

                      the top cause of death followed by cardiovascular diseases and neurological conditions.</p>
                  <p>Self harm is the 10th biggest level 2 cause of death overall in West Sussex (82 deaths, around 1% of all
                      deaths in the county) and for males specifically (61 deaths). For females, however, self-harm does not
                      appear in the top ten level 2 causes of death and is replaced by musculoskeletal disorders as having a
                      greater impact on mortality in West Sussex estimated to be attributable to 50 deaths in 2017 among

            <h3>Deaths</h3>
            <p class='side'>In England, vital registers are maintained by the Office for National Statistics (ONS),
                which record the underlying cause of death for every death. Whilst the GBD study uses these registers
                for estimates of deaths because there is a complete
                population coverage, a small proportion of causes of death are re-coded to other causes in line with
                GBD algorithms identifying non-specific, ill-defined or other causes not considered underlying causes by
                ONS.</p>

                <h3>Level 1 conditions</h3>
                <p class='side'>Level 1 contains three broad cause groups:</p>

                  <h1>Other ways to measure the burden of disease</h1>
                  <p>The leading burdens of disease in West Sussex in 2017 are given in the table below. You'll notice there
                      are actually four top 10s and these reflect the various ways conditions affect our health. Descriptions
                      of each measure of burden are given to the left.</p>
                  <p>Whilst cardiovascular diseases and neoplasms are the biggest contributors to mortality, some conditions
                      which have fairly low mortality rates can cause significant levels of disability.</p>
                  <p>For example, musculoskeletal conditions account for 0.7% of deaths in West Sussex in 2017 (70 deaths) but
                      were estimated to be responsible for almost one in four years of life lived with disability (28,852,
                      23.1%) in West Sussex.</p>
                  <h3>Top ten causes of ill health and mortality; persons; all ages; West Sussex; 2017</h3>
                  <div id="top_10_table"></div>
                  <p>The Disability Adjusted Life Years lost (DALY) measure is the best measure of the combined burden of a
                      disease as it includes the impact of premature mortality as well as years of life lived with the burden
                      of a disease. Whilst the number of deaths in West Sussex was 9,478, if you break down this mortality to
                      the number of premature years potentially lost, the burden exceeds 126,700 years.</p>
                  <p>Importantly, the number of years of life lost (premature death) is comparable with the total estimated
                      number of years people in West Sussex spend living with disability. This indicates that in West Sussex,
                      people are living as much of their life in less than ideal health as they are losing potential years of
                      their life outright. Obviously the level of disability experienced by individuals will vary from minimal
                      interruption to significant disruption of daily life and dependence on others for care.</p>
                  <p>We can see from this measure that neoplasms have the biggest overall impact on health in West Sussex
                      accounting for <b>one in five</b> DALYs, followed by cardiovascular diseases (<b>about one in six</b>
                      DALYs). More than one in every 10 DALYs lost to people in West Sussex (29,655) and musculoskeletal
                      disorders.</p>
                  <p>We now look to explore these condition groups in more detail. Remember, you can hover over the tiles on
                      the right hand side to find out more about each condition group. It should be noted that at this level
                      (level 3), neoplasms are split by each cancer site (e.g. brain, lung etc). These have been grouped
                      together on the left hand side of the figure.</p>

                <div class="right-sidebar">
                  <h3>Years of life lost (YLLs)</h3>
                  <p class='side'>YLLs are calculated by subtracting the age at death from the longest possible life
                      expectancy for a person at that age. For example, if the longest life expectancy for men in a given
                      country is 75, but a man dies of cancer at 65, this would be 10 years of life lost due to cancer.</p>
                  <h3>Years lived with disability (YLDs)</h3>
                  <p class='side'>These are estimates of the number of years lived in less than ideal health. Some conditions
                      such as influenza last for only a few days, whereas epilepsy can last a lifetime. It is measured by
                      taking the prevalence of the condition multiplied
                      by a disability weight which reflects the severity of different conditions and these are developed using
                      a variety of data sources. For England, this includes national surveys, the national cancer registration
                      system, hospital episode statistics and multiple published studies on various disease and condition topics.</p>
                  <h3>Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs)</h3>
                  <p class='side'>One DALY equals one lost year of healthy life and is the sum of years of life lost and years
                      lived with disability. This is the best measure to consider the overall impact of a specific cause or
                      group of causes on a population.</p>

                          <p>The figure illustrates that at this level, ischemic heart disease is the biggest cause of death in West
                              Sussex (1,292 deaths), followed by Alzheimer's disease and other dementias (1,146 deaths), stroke (754
                              deaths), lower respiratory infections (617 deaths) and chronic obstructure pulmonary disease (COPD, 530
                              deaths). The same conditions make up the top five causes of deaths for males although for females,
                              Alzheimer's and other dementias are the biggest cause of death (770 deaths) followed by heart disease
                              (557 deaths).</p>

                            <p>Ischemic heart disease is also the largest contributor to premature mortality estimated to cause 15,731
                                  years of life lost, which is almost double the next biggest cause of premature mortality (Alzheimer's
                                    disease and other dementias; 8,672 YLLs).</p>
                            <p>For females, Alzheimer's and other dementias and heart disease are the top two causes of premature
                                  mortality although of note is that cancers of the breast and lung and trachael cancers as well as stroke
                                    all contribute comparable burden on premature mortality.</p>
                            <p>Exploring the non-fatal burden of disease (years of life lived with disability) shows that low back pain
                                    is the biggest cause of disability (16,066 YLDs), followed by headache disorders (7,422 YLDs),
                                    depressive disorders (6,052 YLDs), neck pain (5,978 YLDs) and hearing loss (including age-related
                                    hearing loss; 5,041 YLDs). Of note, diabetes and falls contribute comparable levels of burden (4,887 and
                                    4,877 years lived with disability) but just miss out on the top five conditions. Also of note is that
                                    neoplams, in comparison, contribute little to years lived with disability.</p>
                                <p>There are some interesting differences among male and female causes of YLDs. For females, the same top
                                    four contions cause the most disability burden, although COPD replaces hearing loss as the fifth biggest
                                    cause of YLDs. For males, low back pain and hearing loss are the top two conditions for YLDs, although
                                    diabetes is the third biggest cause of disability, followed by headache disorders and neck pain.</p>
                                <p>When premature mortality and disability are considered together, ischemic heart disease is the biggest
                                    cause of burden with 16,611 disability adjusted life years lost in West Sussex, in 2017. This is
                                    followed closely by low back pain with 16,066 years lost.</p>
                                <p>Two thirds of DALYs lost as a result of ischemic heart disease in 2017 were among males (11,033 DALYs)
                                    and for males is the biggest cause of burden by a considerable margin. Conversely, 44% (7,038 DALYs) of
                                    the overall burden of low back pain was among males.</p></div>

            <h1>How does ill health affect people of different ages?</h1>
            <p>Some conditions affect people at particular stages in their lives. Thankfully, a large proportion of
                deaths happen after the age of 75 in West Sussex (73%, 6,907 deaths in 2017). However, the non-fatal
                burden of disease can happen much earlier in the life course; with disability concentrated among those
                of working age.</p>
            <p>In this section we explore the age at which death and disability occur, to consider which health
                conditions may be of particular concern for certain age groups.</p>
            <h3>Burden of disease by age group; persons; West Sussex; 2017</h3>
            <div class="switch-field">
                <input onclick="update_age(deaths_age)" type="radio" id="radio-eight" name="switch-three" checked/>

            </div>
            <div id="my_lifecourse_condition_dataviz"></div>
            <p>It is also useful to see the proportion of the burden for each age group to answer the question 'if the
                condition is estimated to cause 100 deaths, how many of those deaths are among people of a certain
                age?'. Answering this question shows us that certain diseases impact people of particular ages
                disproportionately. The switch below effects both the number and proportion of disease burden
                attributed to a condition and age group.</p>

      <p>So far we have looked at ill health for those in West Sussex using the 'crude' or unstandardised values,
          as this gives an idea of the scale of the burden of ill health for our population. We know that age is a
          very important determinent of ill health and disability and from the section above we can see that

      <h3>Standardised values</h3>
      <p class='side'>Looking at crude estimates helps to know what the true impact might be for our area (e.g. to
          anticipate the number of patients a service might need to cater for, the number of cases) and this can
          help to plan services.</p>
      <p class='side'>You could compare these crude estimates with those in other areas, or over time, to see if
          things are better in some areas or are improving over time, although any differences (or similarities)
          in estimates could be at least in part due the underlying differences in populations (e.g. areas with
          fewer or greater numbers of older people, or the shear size of the population).</p>
      <p class='side'>As an example, area A may have recorded 2,000 deaths and area B recorded 1,500 deaths. You
          might think that area A has a much bigger issue of mortality than area B. However, if area A has a
          population of 500,000, the rate of deaths would be 400 deaths per 100,000 population. If area B has a
          population of 300,000, then the rate of deaths is higher in area B (500 per 100,000 population).</p>

The picture was different for DALYs, however, where we observed that 58·2% (56·4–60·3) of DALYs in CMNN causes are attributable to risk factors, compared with 43·5% (40·7–46·7) in NCDs and 21·0% (19·3–22·7) for injuries.

                  <h3>Risk factor</h3>
                  <p class='side'>A risk factor is defined as an attribute, behavior, or exposure, which is causally
                      associated with an increased (or decreased) probability of a disease or injury. Risk factors can be
                      protective if the probability of ill health decreases. It should be noted that each risk factor may be
                      directly or indirectly associated with an outcome and <b>risk factor contribution to ill health is not
                          mutually exclusive</b>.</p>
                  <p class='side'>Furthermore, a combination of risk factors may jointly influence outcomes and there is often
                      overlap of multiple risk factors/exposures. As such, it is not possible to sum the contribution of two
                      or more risk factors (i.e smoking and drinking alcohol) to say these two risk factors cause a certain
                      proportion of the total burden of a condition.</p>
                  <p class='side'>For example, there were estimated to be 2,752 deaths caused by neoplasms in West Sussex in
                      2017. Of those deaths, 43% (1,190 deaths) are attributed to atleast one risk factor in the GBD study. We
                      are able to say that Tobacco use for example, is attributable to 567 deaths as a result of neoplasms,
                      occupational risks were attributable to neoplasm 258 deaths and that alcohol use was attributable to
                      188. We are not able, however, to say that the three risk factors combined account for 1,013 deaths
                      because we do not know the overlapping risk contribution at this level of detail.</p>
                  <p class='side'>Overlap in risk contribution is available for level 1 risks (environmental, behavioural and
                      metabolic risks).</p>
