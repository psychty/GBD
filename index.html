          <h3>The Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD)</h3>
          <p>The GBD is one of the most comprehensive worldwide epidemiological collaborations describing mortality and morbidity from major diseases and injuries and risk factors to health at global, national, regional, and local levels. It provides a standardised approach to estimating incidence (new cases) and prevalence (total number of cases) of ill health and death as well as a measure of the number of potential years lost due to disability, ill health and death.</p>
          <p>Data are available for every year between 1990 and 2017 and each year new data and methodological innovations are fed into models, revising annual estimates for 360 diseases and injuries and 85 risk factors.</p>
          <p>Where possible, local observational data (e.g. mortality and GP records or local studies) are included in the estimates but for a large number of diseases there is simply no recorded information on prevalence.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="main">
          <h1>Key findings</h1>
<ul class = 'summary'>
  <li>Exploring common causes of premature death and disability at higher geographies can mask substantial variation within those areas.</li>
  <li>Low back and neck pain are leading causes of overall disease burden as measured by Disability Adjusted Life Years lost in West Sussex.</li>
  <li>Non-fatal conditions are accounting for an increasingly large amount of overall burden on the health of the nation.</li>
  <li>The findings from the GBD at a local, regional and national level helps policy makers to allocate resources based on the level of burden and target key risk factors.</li>
</ul>
        </div>
        <div class="right_column">
          <h3>Caveats and limitations</h3>
          <p>The GBD ethos is that an uncertain estimate, even when data are sparse or not available, is preferable to no estimate at all. As a result, you should consider that there is a <b>margin of error when interpreting these results as they are simply estimates or <i>'best guesses'</i></b>.</p>
          <p>Estimates from the GBD do not compare directly to reported statistics within England (where these are available) as all estimates are constructed using the GBD methodology.</p>
          <p>A change in rank does not necessarily mean that a metric for a cause has got better/worse.<p>
          <p>Whilst risk factors are presented in three groups, these should not be viewed as mutually exclusive. It is clear that behavioural risks (such as diet) are associated with metabolic risks (such as obesity)</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="left_column">
        <h3>Deaths</h3>
        <p>In England, vital registers are maintained by the Office for National Statistics (ONS), which record the underlying cause of death for every death. Whilst the GBD study uses these registers for estimates of deaths because there is a complete
          population coverage, a small proportion of causes of death are re-coded to other causes in line with GBD algorithms identifying non-specific, ill-defined or other causes not considered underlying causes by ONS.</p>
        <h3>Years of life lost</h3>
        <p>YLLs are calculated by subtracting the age at death from the longest possible life expectancy for a person at that age. For example, if the longest life expectancy for men in a given country is 75, but a man dies of cancer at 65, this would
          be 10 years of life lost due to cancer.</p>
        <h3>Years lived with disability</h3>
        <p>These are estimates of the number of years lived in less than ideal health. Some conditions such as influenza last for only a few days, whereas epilepsy can last a lifetime. It is measured by taking the prevalence of the condition multiplied
          by a disability weight which reflects the severity of different conditions and these are developed using a variety of data sources. For England, this includes national surveys, the national cancer registration system, hospital episode
          statistics and multiple published studies on various disease and condition topics.</p>
        <h3>Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs)</h3>
        <p>One DALY equals one lost year of healthy life and is the sum of years of life lost and years lived with disability. This is the best measure to consider the overall impact of a specific cause or group of causes on a population.</p>

        <h1>How does ill health affect people of different ages?</h1>
        <p>We have already looked at measures of premature mortality and morbidity, that is ill health that occurs earlier than naturally expected, but we can also look at which conditions impact people across the lifecourse.</p>

        <div class="switch-field">
          <input onclick="update_age(deaths_age)" type="radio" id="radio-eight" name="switch-three" checked />

        <p>We can see from this that disability is concentrated on those of working age</p>
        <p>Whilst it is useful to see the number of deaths or years lost for a condition, it is also useful to see the proportion of the burden for each age group to answer the question 'if the condition is estimated to cause 100 deaths, how many of those deaths are among people of a certain age?'. Answering this question shows us that certain diseases impact people of particular ages disproportionately. The switch below effects both the number and proportion of disease burden
          attributed to a condition and age group.</p>

        <h3>Standardised values</h3>
        <p>Looking at crude estimates helps to know what the true impact might be for our area (e.g. to anticipate the number of patients a service might need to cater for, the number of cases) and this can help to plan services.</p>
        <p>You could compare these crude estimates with those in other areas, or over time, to see if things are better in some areas or are improving over time, although any differences (or similarities) in estimates could be at least in part due the underlying differences in populations (e.g. areas with fewer or greater numbers of older people, or the shear size of the population).</p>
        <p>As an example, area A may have recorded 2,000 deaths and area B recorded 1,500 deaths. You might think that area A has a much bigger issue of mortality than area B. However, if area A has a population of 500,000, the rate of deaths would be 400 deaths per 100,000 population. If area B has a population of 300,000, then the rate of deaths is higher in area B (500 per 100,000 population).</p>

      <div class="main">
        <h1>Exploring changes over time and across areas</h1>
        <p>So far we have looked at ill health for those in West Sussex using the 'crude' or unstandardised values, as this gives an idea of the scale of the burden of ill health for our population. We know that age is a very important determinent of ill health and disability and from the section above we can see that conditions affect people of different ages.</p>
        <p>To account for differences in population size and demographics, the remaining analyses use <font color="#256cb2"><b>standardised estimates</b></font> which detail the number (e.g. deaths) per 100,000 population.</p>

        <h3>Risk factor</h3>
        <p>A risk factor is defined as an attribute, behavior, or exposure, which is causally associated with an increased (or decreased) probability of a disease or injury. Risk factors can be protective if the probability of ill health decreases. It should be noted that each risk factor may be directly or indirectly associated with an outcome and <b>risk factor contribution to ill health is not mutually exclusive</b>.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, a combination of risk factors may jointly influence outcomes and there is often overlap of multiple risk factors/exposures. As such, it is not possible to sum the contribution of two or more risk factors (i.e smoking and drinking alcohol) to say these two risk factors cause a certain proportion of the total burden of a condition.</p>
        <p>For example, there were estimated to be 2,752 deaths caused by neoplasms in West Sussex in 2017. Of those deaths, 43% (1,190 deaths) are attributed to atleast one risk factor in the GBD study. We are able to say that Tobacco use for example, is attributable to 567 deaths as a result of neoplasms, occupational risks were attributable to neoplasm 258 deaths and that alcohol use was attributable to 188. We are not able, however, to say that the three risk factors combined account for 1,013 deaths because we do not know the overlapping risk contribution at this level of detail.</p>
        <p>Overlap in risk contribution is available for level 1 risks (environmental, behavioural and metabolic risks).</p>
      </div>
      <div class="main">
        <h1>Attributing risk to the burden of disease</h1>
        <!-- <p>Globally, 59·9% (58·4–61·3) of deaths and 45·2% (43·2–47·3) of DALYs could be attributed to the risk factors assessed in GBD 2016. For deaths, non-communicable diseases (NCDs) show the largest proportion attributable to measured risk factors, at 64·4% (62·6–66·2), with communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional (CMNN) causes at 57·9% (55·4–61·0), and injuries at 25·8% (23·7–27·8). The picture was different for DALYs, however, where we observed that 58·2% (56·4–60·3) of DALYs in CMNN causes are attributable to risk factors, compared with 43·5% (40·7–46·7) in NCDs and 21·0% (19·3–22·7) for injuries. Leading causes of DALYs in CMNN causes, such as diarrhoea and lower respiratory infections (LRI), also showed more than 80% of DALYs can be attributed to risk factors (appendix 2 p 1).</p> -->
