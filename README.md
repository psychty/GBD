# Global Burden of Disease

This site displays the West Sussex extract of the Global Burden of Disease study (GBD) 2018.

The Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD) is one of the most comprehensive worldwide epidemiological collaborations describing mortality and morbidity from major diseases and injuries and risk factors to health at global, national, regional, and local levels. Data are available for every year between 1990 and 2017 and each year new data and methodological innovations are fed into the models, revising annual estimates for 360 diseases and injuries and 85 risk factors.

Where possible, local observational data (e.g. mortality and GP records or local studies) are included in the estimates but for a large number of diseases there is simply no recorded information on prevalence. The GBD ethos is that an uncertain estimate, even when data are sparse or not available, is preferable to no estimate at all.
